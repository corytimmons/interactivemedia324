She's a low-brow/high-concept kind of girl.

Her hobbies include DIY bullshit at home, playing video games, tumbling rocks, gardening, and eating chocolate cake. 

Her politics are to the left of Noam Chomsky.

She likes art that is expressive, absurd, and narrative. 

She has recently reappropriated heterosexuality. 

Humorous, quick-paced novels filled with crass, alongside nonfiction about gender and politics and fantasy fiction. 

You’ll often find her at the thrift shops flipping through racks looking for clothes, housewares, materials, or projects (see: DIY bullshit). 

She likes pants. 

She’d love to work with you.
